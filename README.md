#Makers Academy Week 7 - RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock in JavaScript

##The Challenge

In week five I coded Rock, Paper, Scissors in Ruby on a Sinatra server
([Git repo](https://github.com/ruthearle/rockpaperscissors) and live on [Heroku](https://rps-production.herokuapp.com/)).


This challenge was to make a JavaScript version of Rock, Paper, Scissors with
the addition of Lizard, Spock, Ã  la The Big Bang Theory. Hosted on [Heroku](http://rockpaperscissorslizardspockjs.herokuapp.com/
).

Enjoy!
