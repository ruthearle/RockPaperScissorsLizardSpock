#Makers Academy Week 7 - RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock in JavaScript

##The Challenge

In week five I coded Rock, Paper, Scissors in Ruby on a Sinatra server
[Git repo](https://github.com/ruthearle/rockpaperscissors) and live on [Heroku](https://rps-production.herokuapp.com/).


This challenge turned the Ruby version into a JavaScript version with
the addition of Lizard, Spock, Ã  la The Big Bang Theory.

Enjoy!
